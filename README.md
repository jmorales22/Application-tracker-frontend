## AppTrack
AppTrack is the way for you to keep up with the jobs you have applied for.  In addition to keeping track, we let you give feedback about the interview experience- for example: was there whiteboarding? Or a code challenge? Was the interview easy or difficult?  We let you provide us with details on your experience to help others.

Once a user is signed up to use the service, they can review the history of other users job applications and interviews as well as input their own applications and interviews. Not only does this make keeping up with where you have applied easier, it also gives you access to information from others. It is a great way to manage your applications and interviews and keep track of whom to contact at the companies you have interviewed with.  

In choosing which technologies to use, we went with what we felt we understood the most and could leverage to build the best app.  We were able to utilize each other's strengths and work together to build a functional app that can help those in the software industry log their application path from start to hired.  

In our app you can find:<br/>

## Get started with the app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
